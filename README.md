## 1. Introduction to Flutter Widgets 🧩

Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. At the heart of Flutter are **widgets**, which are the building blocks of the UI. Widgets can be categorized into two main types:

- **Visible Widgets**: These are widgets that are displayed on the screen, such as `Text`, `Icon`, and `Button`.
- **Invisible Widgets**: These are layout widgets that control the positioning and arrangement of other widgets, such as `Column`, `Row`, and `Center`.

## 2. Visible vs. Invisible Widgets 👀

### 📝 Visible Widgets
Visible widgets are the ones that users can see and interact with. Examples include:

- **Text**: Displays a string of text.
- **Icon**: Displays an icon from the Material Design library.
- **Button**: Allows users to perform actions when clicked.

### 📝 Invisible Widgets
Invisible widgets, also known as **layout widgets**, are used to arrange and position other widgets. Examples include:

- **Column**: Arranges widgets vertically.
- **Row**: Arranges widgets horizontally.
- **Center**: Centers a widget within its parent.

## 3. Layout Widgets: Column, Row, and Stack 📏

### 📝 Column Widget
The `Column` widget arranges its children in a vertical sequence. By default, it takes up the maximum height available and aligns its children along the **main axis** (vertical axis).

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  children: [
    Container(width: 200, height: 50, color: Colors.green),
    Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
    Container(width: 100, height: 100, color: Colors.amber),
  ],
)
```

### 📝 Row Widget
The `Row` widget arranges its children in a horizontal sequence. By default, it takes up the maximum width available and aligns its children along the **main axis** (horizontal axis).

```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.green),
    Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
    Container(width: 100, height: 100, color: Colors.amber),
  ],
)
```

### 📝 Stack Widget
The `Stack` widget allows you to overlay multiple widgets on top of each other. The last widget in the list will be displayed on top.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    Container(width: 400, height: 400, color: Colors.red),
    Container(width: 300, height: 300, color: Colors.blue),
    Container(width: 200, height: 200, color: Colors.green),
  ],
)
```

## 4. Container Widget: A Versatile Tool 🧰

The `Container` widget is a versatile widget that can be used as both a visible and invisible widget. It can be used to:

- Add padding, margins, and borders.
- Set a background color or image.
- Control the size and alignment of its child.

```dart
Container(
  width: 200,
  height: 100,
  color: Colors.blue,
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
)
```

---

## 5. Main Axis and Cross Axis Alignment 🔄

### 📝 Main Axis Alignment
The **main axis** is the primary axis along which widgets are arranged. For a `Column`, it’s vertical, and for a `Row`, it’s horizontal. You can control the alignment using the `mainAxisAlignment` property.

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Aligns children in the center
  children: [...],
)
```

### 📝 Cross Axis Alignment
The **cross axis** is the secondary axis. For a `Column`, it’s horizontal, and for a `Row`, it’s vertical. You can control the alignment using the `crossAxisAlignment` property.

```dart
Row(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start, // Aligns children at the start
  children: [...],
)
```

## 6. Practical Code Examples 💻

Here’s a complete example that demonstrates the use of `Column`, `Row`, and `Stack` widgets:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Layouts')),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Container(width: 200, height: 50, color: Colors.green),
            Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
            Container(width: 100, height: 100, color: Colors.amber),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
              children: [
                Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.red),
                Container(width: 50, height: 50, color: Colors.purple),
              ],
            ),
            Stack(
              children: [
                Container(width: 400, height: 400, color: Colors.red),
                Container(width: 300, height: 300, color: Colors.blue),
                Container(width: 200, height: 200, color: Colors.green),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
